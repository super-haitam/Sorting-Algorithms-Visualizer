# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer
 This project is made to visualize sorting algorithms by sorting a shuffled array of 900 elements (WIDTH), each element has a value between 0 & 900 (WIDTH).

### Parts
 When running this project, you'll see a Tkinter window pop up and also a pygame window.
The TKINTER WINDOW will let you choose the sorting algorithm you want and also display a _Shuffle_ Button to shuffle the array and a _Sort_ Button to sort the array with the chosen sorting algorithm.
The PYGAME WINDOW will display the array with each element is represented by a white rectangle, its height is proportional to its value.

### Available sorting algorithms
The Sorting Algorithms that you can choose from are:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Cocktail Shacker Sort
- Comb Sort
- OddEven Sort
